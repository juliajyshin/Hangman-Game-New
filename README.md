## Project Description

This is a simple computer game of hangman featuring Pokemon. It features dynamically updated HTML powered by Javascript. To play, simply start by pressing any key to guess a letter. If you guess the Pokemon name correctly, the image of the Pokemon will appear the "Who's that Pokemon" box. Whether the player wins or loses, the game will automatically keep score and choose another word for the user to play. If you want to restart your score, you can refresh your browser. If the theme song bothers you, you can always right click your browser window and mute the sound.
